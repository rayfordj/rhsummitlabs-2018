== Optimize your IT, VM Migration made easy by Red Hat- Lab Guide

:numbered:

== Overview

This Lab Environment uses Red Hat CloudForms, and the Infrastructure Migration plugin (a.k.a. v2v-plugin), as a broker to migrate VMs from VMware vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization. 
 
The provided configuration steps include:

* Check the configuration of the conversion hosts in the target provider (RHV)
* Check credentials for virtualization providers and conversion hosts in CloudForms
* Assign tags for the conversion hosts in CloudForms
* CSV file created for the chosen VMs to be migrated

The providers are:

* Source - VMware vSphere
* Target - Red Hat Virtualization

After this initial step, the resource equivalence between the two providers has to be defined in an *Infrastucture Mapping* including:

* Clusters
* Storage Domains
* Networks

To perform the migration one *Conversion Host* has beeen configured. In this case RHEL hypervisors were used as conversion hosts.

Finally, a *Migration Plan* has to be executed to perform the final migration.

.Goal
* Migrate several VMs from vSphere to Red Hat Virtualization, using Red Hat CloudForms as a broker, with a Red Hat Solution: Infrastructure Migration
+
NOTE: The source VMs are still maintained post migration and are not deleted. This allows for "failback" if a migration failure occurs.

|=======

.Prerequisites

* Deployment of the demo environment which includes the following VMs provisioned in the vSphere environment:
** `jboss0` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `jboss1` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running JBoss EAP
** `lb` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running Nginx configured to proxy traffic to `jboss0` and `jboss1`
** `db` - a Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 host running PostgreSQL that the `jboss0` and `jboss1` application servers connect to

* An external service is configured as https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com pointing to the Load Balancer to make the Ticket Monster app accesible.

== Getting Started

. Once the system is running, use SSH to access your demo server via SSH.

* Using a Unix/Linux system:
+
----
$ ssh workstation-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
----

. Become `root` using sudo:
+
----
$ sudo -i
----

. Check the status of the environment using ansible:
+
----
# ansible all -m ping
----
+
This command establishes a connection to all the machines in the environment (except ESXi servers). 
In case the machines are up an running a success message, per each, will show up. 
This is an example of a success message for the VM jboss0.example.com:
+
----
jboss0.example.com | SUCCESS => {
    "changed": false, 
    "ping": "pong"
}
----
+ 
There are 4 VMs in the vCenter environment hosting an app with Nginx as loadbalancer, two JBoss EAP in domain mode, and a Postgresql database.
To check only if these ones are running, you may use the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----
+ 
To check the infrastructure machines the following command can be also used:
+
----
# ansible infra -m ping
----

. Establish an SSH connection to the CloudForms server and monitor `automation.log`:
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
[TIP]
The log entries are very long, so it helps if you stretch this window as wide as possible.
+
[NOTE]
The log entries can be also seen in the CloudForms web UI in *Automation -> Automate -> Log*.

. Verify the Ticket Monster app is running:

* Point your browser to https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com and check it is running:
+
image::app-ticketmonster-running.png[Ticket Monster app running]
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.
+
image::ssl_cert_warning.png[SSL Cert Warning]

. Prepare to manage the environment. From a web browser, open each of the URLs below in its own window or tab, using these credentials (except when noted):

* *Username*: `admin`
* *Password*: `<to_be_provided>`
+
[NOTE]
You must accept all of the self-signed SSL certificates.

* *Red Hat Virtualization Manager:* `https://rhvm-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
.. Navigate to and click *Administration Portal* and log in using `admin`, `<to_be_provided>`, and `internal`.
+
image::rhv_login.png[RHV Login]

.. Verify the Cluster is up and Hypervisors are active
+
[TIP]
As this is nested virtualization, sometimes the CPU type of the hypervisor is changed. 
+
image::rhv_hypervisors_up.png[RHV Hypervisors up]

* *vCenter:* `https://vcenter-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com`
+
image::vsphere_web_client_0.png[vCenter Login]

** Flash Player is required.
+
[TIP]
Modern browsers have flash player disabled by default. You may need to enable it for this page. Here are the link:01-redhat_solutions-insfrastructure_migration_v2-enable_flash.adoc[instructions to enable Adobe Flash]

* Click on *Log in to vSphere Web Client*
+
image::vsphere_web_client_1.png[vSphere Web Client Login]

=== Validate the Current Infrastructure in CloudForms

. On the CloudForms web interface, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Providers*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_1.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 1]

. If you see an exclamation mark (*!*), or a cross (*x*) in a provider, check the provider's box, go to *Authentication -> Re-check Authentication Status*.
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_2.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 2]
+
image::cloudforms_infrastructure_providers_3.png[CloudForms Infrastructure Providers 3]
+
[TIP]
Take into account that vCenter may take longer to start.

. Go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Virtual Machines -> VMs -> All VMs*.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_1.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 1]

. All VMs, Orphaned VMs and Templates in both RHV and vSphere show as entities in CloudForms.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_2.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 2]
+
[NOTE]
If you needed to validate providers, you may have to wait a few minutes and refresh the screen before the VMs show up.

. Select the pane *VMs & Templates* and, in it, the *VMware* provider.

. Only the VMs and Templates in vSphere will show.
+
image::cloudforms_vms_3.png[CloudForms Virtual Machines 3]

=== Check Conversion Hosts

. On the `cf` system, go to *Compute -> Infrastructure -> Hosts*.
+
image::conversion_host_1.png[Conversion Host 1]

. Click *kvm0*.
+
image::conversion_host_2.png[Conversion Host 2]

. Select *Policy -> Edit Tags*.
+
image::conversion_host_3.png[Conversion Host 3]

. Confirm *V2V - Transformation Host* has value *t* (for true) and *V2V - Transformation Method* tag has value *VDDK*. Click *Cancel*.
+
image::conversion_host_6.png[Conversion Host 6]
+
* These values may also be observed in the *Smart Management* box in the host description
+
image::conversion_host_7.png[Conversion Host 7]

. Select *Configuration -> Edit this item* (back in `kvm0`).
+
image::conversion_host_8.png[Conversion Host 8]

. Confirm *Username* has `root` and Password is set. You can click *Validate* to verify they are OK then the message "Credential validation was successful" will appear. This is needed to be able to connect to the conversion host and initiate the conversion.
+
image::conversion_host_9.png[Conversion Host 9]

. The conversion host is ready.


=== Create an Infrastructure Mapping

. Navigate to the *Compute -> Migration -> Overview*. Click on *Create Infrastructure Mapping*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_2.png[Infrastructure Mapping 2]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, type the name `ticket-monster-mapping` and click *next*.
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the mapping.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_3.png[Infrastructure Mapping 3]

.  In the *step 2* of the wizard, *Clusters*, select *Source Cluster* as `Cluster01` and *Target Cluster* as `TrustedCluster` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_4.png[Infrastructure Mapping 4]

.  In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Datastores*, select *Source Datastore* as `Datastore` and *Target Datastore* as `vmstore00` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *next*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_5.png[Infrastructure Mapping 5]

.  In the *step 4* of the wizard, *Networks*, select *Source Network* as `VM Network` and *Target Network* as `ovirtmgmt` and click *Add Mapping*, then click *create*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_6.png[Infrastructure Mapping 6]

.  In the *step 5* of the wizard, *Results*, a message `All mappings in ticket-monster-mapping have been mapped.` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::infrastructure_mapping_7.png[Infrastructure Mapping 7]

In these steps an *Înfrastructure Mapping* has been created in order to simplify source and target resources using the data collected by Red hat CloudForms from both VMware vSphere and Red Hat Virtualization.

=== Create an Migration Plan

. Start in the CloudForms page accessed by navigating to *Compute -> Migration -> Overview*, which is the finishing page from previous step.

. Click on *Create Migration Plan*.
+
image::migration_plan_1.png[Migration Plan 1]

. In the *step 1* of the wizard, *General*, select the *Infrastructure Mapping* to be used, `ticket-monster-mapping`, add the name `Ticket Monster plan` and click *next*.
+
image::migration_plan_2.png[Migration Plan 2]
+
* A description may be added to make it easy to, later on, recognize the usage of the plan.

. In a different brower page, download the CSV file with the VMs link:https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RedHatDemos/RHS-Optimize_IT-Infrastructure_Migration/master/notes/ticket_monster_migration.csv[ticket_monster_migration.csv]
+
image::migration_plan_3.png[Migration Plan 3]
+
[NOTE]
This step will be kept for massive migrations, however, a different interface to choose VMs to be migrated is expected in the near term
+
[TIP]
To get the VM ids, for the CVS file, can be obtained from a web browser by accessing the following CloudForms URL (remember to change the GUID):  https://cf-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com/api/vms?expand=resources
+
[TIP]
To get the VM ids via command line, the following commands can be run in ManageIQ/CloudForms:
+
        # cd /var/www/miq/vmdb
        # bundle exec rails c
        irb> Vm.find_by(:name => "<VM_NAME>").id
+
[WARNING]
If the CloudForms environment has been reconfigured, the csv file may need to be regenerated as the VM ids in CloudForms could have changed.

. In the *step 2* of the wizard, *VMs*, select the *Browse* to select a CSV file with the names of the VMs to be migrated. Then select `ticket_monster_migration.csv` and click *Open*.
+
image::migration_plan_4.png[Migration Plan 4]

. The list of the VMs to be migrated shall appear on screen. Review and click *create*.
+
image::migration_plan_5.png[Migration Plan 5]

. In the *step 3* of the wizard, *Results*, the message `Migration Plan: ticket-monster-plan is in progress` shall appear. Click *close*.
+
image::migration_plan_6.png[Migration Plan 6]

. Now the migration is executing. We can see the orchestration process in Cloudforms logs
+
----
# ssh cf.example.com
# tail -f /var/www/miq/vmdb/log/automation.log
----
+
And each VM migration process in the Conversion Host:
+
----
# ssh kvm0.example.com
# tail -f /var/log/vdsm/import/*
----

. CloudForms interface shows migration status too
+
image::migration_running_1.png[Migration Running 1]

. In RHV interface we can see starting to appear
+
image::migration_running_2.png[Migration Running 2]

. Migration finishes
+
image::migration_running_3.png[Migration Running 3]

. Let's check if the VMs are up and running using the following command:
+
----
# ansible app -m ping
----

. It's time to check the *app* running and accessible via the URL https://app-<YOUR-GUID>.rhpds.opentlc.com
+
image::migration_running_5.png[Migration Running 5]

And, with this, the Lab is done!. We hope you enjoyed it!
